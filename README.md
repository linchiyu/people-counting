# people-counting
A footfall python people counting

This code is based on Footfall from WatershedArts (https://github.com/WatershedArts/Footfall)

I made this people counting with python.
It is still in development and I've got a couple of versions (that is inside the project), any help or suggestion is welcomed.

I'm still new to github and english is not my main language, so sorry if there are some misspelled words and code mistakes.

Requirements:

Python 3

OPENCV 3.4

Numpy


How to run:

make sure to edit config.json (Footfall > CameraConfig > camerasource) to your camera source (0, 1, or "pi" for raspberry pi)

run: python3 main.py

Hope this project helps you in any way.
